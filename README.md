# T4-Generative-AI

El propósito de ésta tarea es con el fin de evaluar mis subcompetencias aprendidas sobre las Técnicas y Arquitecturas de Deep Learning. 

Assignment:
1. Analyze one GAN or RNN (next page), go through the example, make your own copy of the
notebook and make notes on them.

2. Find out what the code is doing and how is doing it (explaining the most important steps).
   
3. You may add extra ‘prints’ if you wish to display additional outputs.
   
4. Make one of the following Changes:

   • learning rate or the type of Optimizer (GANs/RNNs)
   
   • percentage of the Dropout (GANs/RNNs; usually for RNNs there are 2 dropout values)
   
   • size of the images (GANs; only if the training process does not take longer than 10 hours)
   
   • redesign or add a layer (GANs; only if the training process does not take longer than 10 hours)
   
   • size of the vocabulary or size of sequence used (RNNs; only if the training process does not take longer than 10 minutes)
   
   • embedding length (RNN; only if the training process does not take longer than 10 hours)

6. Train and Evaluate
   
7. Explain the change and the new results.
